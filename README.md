<h1> Gene Co-Expression Analysis Tool 
  
<h6> This tool generates a user-friendly output that helps look at correlation patterns among gene expression data in RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq. The input files required for this tool are two CSV/text files with differential gene expression (DGE) data from either a RNA-seq experiment or a scRNA-seq experiment. The tool filters for the significant genes among two datasets and sorts them based on log2fold change ranges. Once sorted, the ranges are compared between the two input files. This allows users to look at gene expression data at a closer level and find correlational patterns among two DGE lists. This tool can help identify gene candidates with regulatory roles, genes with tissue-specific correlations, and much more. However, the output is only a relative comparison. Definite conclusions can be drawn based on wet lab experiments. <h4>
